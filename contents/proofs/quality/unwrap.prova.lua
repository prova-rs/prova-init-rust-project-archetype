-- Quality gate: production code does not sprout new .unwrap()/.expect() calls — both are latent
-- panics. Test code uses them freely (idiomatic), so we count only lib+bin targets via clippy's
-- restriction lints, which exclude tests, and ratchet the counts against the committed baseline in
-- .prova/baselines/quality.json (lower is better). No new ones allowed; removing them is welcome —
-- run `prova run quality --update-baseline` to tighten the floor once you have. The ritual
-- establishes the floors wherever the project stands: zero on a fresh tree, the honest count on a
-- legacy one — existing debt becomes ratcheted standing debt, not a wall of red.
--
-- To SCHEDULE a paydown, add a `goal` beside the metric's value in the baseline file
-- (`"goal": 15.0`): the ratchet then FAILS the run when the goal is reached, demanding you bank
-- the gain and retire or lower the goal — reaching a target is a decision point, never a silent
-- pass. It is how a standing count becomes a burndown with a deadline someone actually hits.
--
-- HEAVY (recompiles with the restriction lints enabled): behind the `quality` switch, same as the
-- clippy wall. One clippy invocation feeds all three counts via a file-scoped fixture.
