-- Quality gate: production code does not sprout new .unwrap()/.expect() calls — both are latent
-- panics. Test code uses them freely (idiomatic), so we count only lib+bin targets via clippy's
-- restriction lints, which exclude tests, and ratchet the counts against the committed baseline in
-- .prova/baselines/quality.json (lower is better). No new ones allowed; removing them is welcome —
-- run `prova run quality --update-baseline` to tighten the floor once you have. The scaffold
-- starts every count at zero: the strongest floor is the one you never had to dig back up to.
--
-- HEAVY (recompiles with the restriction lints enabled): behind the `quality` switch, same as the
-- clippy wall. One clippy invocation feeds all three counts via a file-scoped fixture.
