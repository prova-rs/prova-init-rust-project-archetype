--- The deputed unit-test leg: `prova run ut` conducts cargo nextest ONCE for the whole workspace —
--- compilation and execution both live in a file-scoped fixture that emits one junit artifact —
--- then one proof adopts every case into the account, and sibling readers can bind claims to
--- named cases at zero additional compilations (conduct once, read many).
---
--- The `ut` switch (suite.lua) is intent; `cargo-nextest` stays a `requires` world fact: two facts
--- with two remedies. The profile `must_run`s the deputy, so `prova run ut` fails rather than
--- skips when nextest is missing — a profile is a contract, not a courtesy.
---
--- A workspace with ZERO unit tests reads RED here, deliberately: `prova run ut` asked for the
--- unit-test account and there is none to adopt. On a legacy project that has never written unit
--- tests, that red is the leg telling you where to start — not a gate to weaken.

-- Conduct the deputy once. The stale artifact is removed FIRST, so a deputy that dies before
-- emitting (a compile error) leaves nothing behind and the adoption fails loudly on "matched
-- nothing" — never a previous run's verdicts wearing this run's face. The deputy's exit code is
-- deliberately not asserted here: the adopting proof reports red with the deputed cases' own
-- names, which a fixture death would hide.
-- The `prova` profile (junit emission, fail-fast off) ships in .prova/nextest.toml and reaches
-- nextest as TOOL config — composing under, never colliding with, the project's own
-- .config/nextest.toml. A repo-defined [profile.prova] would win, deliberately.
